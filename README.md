# 🏨 AtliQ Grands Revenue Insights Dashboard – Power BI Project

## 📖 Project Story

Imagine walking into a luxurious hotel that has been a five-star symbol of elegance for over two decades. That's **AtliQ Grands** — a name well-known in the hospitality industry across India. But recently, this legacy has been challenged. Competitors with sharper strategies and smarter data decisions have started eating away at AtliQ Grands' market share.  

💡 That’s where I stepped in — not with a cape, but with Power BI, data models, and a deep intent to uncover the *why* behind declining revenues.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

**AtliQ Grands** had no in-house analytics team and was struggling to understand why revenue and performance were dipping across properties. Their **Revenue Management Team** decided to outsource analytics and gain data-driven insights for better decisions.

As a data analyst, I was given:
- Raw historical data
- A stakeholder-provided dashboard mockup
- A metric list

## 🛠️ My Role

I took ownership of:
- Data modeling and transformation
- Creating calculated fields and DAX measures
- Building an interactive dashboard in Power BI
- Deriving meaningful **insights** beyond what was expected

## 📊 Project Objective

> **"Convert historical hotel data into actionable insights that drive revenue decisions."**

Using historical performance metrics, my goal was to answer:
- What’s dragging down revenue?
- Which hotels are underperforming?
- Are certain market segments doing better than others?
- How can we compare performance across time and region?

## 📌 Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI** (Data modeling, visualizations)
- **DAX** (for calculated fields and KPIs)
- **Power Query** (Data Cleaning & M Transformations)
- **Excel** (Initial data exploration)

## 🔍 Insights Uncovered

📉 Some properties had high occupancy but low ADR, indicating possible underpricing.  
📈 Online Travel Agents (OTA) brought high volume, but Corporate clients brought higher revenue per room.  
📆 Revenue dips were seasonal, but some were due to internal mispricing or poor segment targeting.

## 🧠 Learnings

- Built a complete BI workflow from raw data to executive dashboard
- Mastered business KPIs like ADR, RevPAR, and Occupancy Rate
- Gained storytelling experience using data to support strategic decisions
